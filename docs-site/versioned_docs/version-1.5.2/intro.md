# Introduction

Welcome to the official **Obsidian MOC Plugin** documentation.

## What is it?

The Obsidian MOC Plugin is a smart **Map of Content** generator for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It automatically organizes your notes into structured, navigable maps so you can explore your knowledge graph with ease.

## Features

- **Interactive MOC Creation Wizard**: Build complex query blocks visually without manually writing YAML.
- **Dynamic Element Extraction**: Extract specific elements like **Lists**, **Tasks**, **Headings**, **Paragraphs**, or **Blockquotes** from markdown notes.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Match elements by exact word, text patterns, tags, task completion status, regular expressions, or frontmatter properties — with full boolean logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
- **Property Comparison Operators**: Filter by frontmatter values using `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for numeric and date comparisons.
- **Hierarchical Grouping**: Group matching elements dynamically by **folder**, **creation date (cday)**, **modification date (mday)**, **tag**, or any **frontmatter property**.
- **Sorting**: Sort scanned files by filename, creation date, or modification date.
- **File and Result Limits**: Limit notes scanned (`fileLimit`), total results shown (`blockLimit`), or results taken from any one note (`blocksPerFile`).
- **Pagination**: Page through notes with `fileOffset` or through results with `blockOffset`.
- **Show Count**: Append result count summaries to MOC blocks and per-group headings.
- **Exclude Options**: Skip specific folders or files from results using `excludeFolder` and `excludeFile`.
- **Custom Output Templates**: Format each matched element using a reusable template note (referenced by name via the `template` option) with `{{content}}`, `{{file}}`, `{{path}}`, and `{{link}}` placeholders.
- **Reusable Find & Replace Rules**: Define text transformations globally in plugin settings and apply them singly or in sequential chains to clean up extracted block text.
- **Decoupled Block & Note Separators**: Separately control separators (e.g. blank lines, horizontal rules) between blocks from the same note and different note sections.
- **Interactive Tasks**: Tick a task checkbox inside a rendered MOC block and the change is written straight back to its source note.
- **Jump to Source**: Every matched block gets a button that opens its source note at the exact line the block starts at.
- **Live Auto-refresh**: MOC blocks automatically re-render when files in the watched folder are created, modified, deleted, renamed, or moved — no manual refresh needed.
- **Copy as Markdown**: Copy the rendered MOC output to clipboard without modifying the note.
- **Bake to Markdown**: Instantly convert dynamic blocks into static markdown notes directly inside the editor.
- **Create Showcase**: Generate a ready-to-explore demo folder covering every feature with a single command.

## Installation

### From the Community Plugin browser

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Select **Browse** and search for `Maps of Content`.
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable**.

### Manual installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mkshp-dev/obsidian-MOC-plugin/releases).
2. Copy the files to your vault's plugin directory: `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-MOC-plugin/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin under **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to generate your first Map of Content is to use the interactive wizard:

1. Click the **Create map of content block** icon (a list icon) in the ribbon on the left side of Obsidian, or open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and run the command **Create map of content block**.
2. Configure your search directory, target element, and filters in the modal.
3. Click **Insert block** to generate the dynamic `moc` code block at your current cursor position.

Alternatively, run **Create showcase** from the Command Palette to generate an example folder with sample notes and pre-built MOC blocks covering every feature — a great way to explore the plugin without writing any configuration.
