# Examples

### Extracting tasks grouped by folder
Search the `Projects/` folder recursively for incomplete tasks, sorting notes by filename, and grouping the output by their parent folder path:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Projects
element: Task
filter: is_incomplete()
recursive: true
groupBy: folder
sort: name asc
```
````

### Extracting headings filtered by tag and grouped by tag
Search the entire vault for headings containing the hashtag `#review`, grouping them under their corresponding tag headings:

````yaml
```moc
folder: ""
element: Heading
filter: has_tag("#review")
recursive: true
groupBy: tag
```
````

### Filtering by frontmatter properties (equality)
Extract lists from notes in the `Archive` folder that have the frontmatter property `archived: true`:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Archive
element: List
filter: properties(archived == true)
```
````

### Filtering by numeric comparison operators
Extract action item headings from notes where `priority` is 1 or 2:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Projects
element: Heading
filter: properties(priority <= 2)
recursive: true
sort: name asc
```
````

### Filtering by date range
Extract all decision blockquotes from notes created in 2024 or later:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Meetings
element: Blockquote
filter: has_tag("#decision") AND properties(date >= "2024-01-01")
recursive: true
```
````

### Grouping by frontmatter property
Group incomplete tasks by their `project` property value:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Work
element: Task
filter: is_incomplete()
groupBy: property(project)
recursive: true
showCount: true
```
````

### Paginating notes
Show only the second page of 5 notes (notes 6–10), sorted by modification time:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Diary
element: List
filter: contains("idea")
sort: mtime desc
fileOffset: 5
fileLimit: 5
```
````

### Paginating results
Show results 21–40, counting matched elements rather than notes:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Diary
element: List
filter: contains("idea")
recursive: true
sort: mtime desc
blockOffset: 20
blockLimit: 20
showCount: true
```
````

### A balanced digest of what is outstanding
Show up to 20 open tasks, taking at most 2 from any single note so that one busy note
cannot crowd out the rest:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Projects
element: Task
filter: is_incomplete()
recursive: true
sort: mtime desc
blocksPerFile: 2
blockLimit: 20
showCount: true
```
````

### Excluding folders and files
Scan all meeting notes recursively but skip archived folders and a template file:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Meetings
element: Task
filter: is_incomplete()
recursive: true
excludeFolder: Meetings/Archive
excludeFile: Meetings/Template
```
````

### Custom template output
Render each matched blockquote as a linked bullet point. First set a **Template folder** (e.g. `Templates`) in **Settings → Maps of Content**, then create a note at `Templates/bullet-link.md` containing:

```
- {{content}} — {{link}}
```

Reference it by name in the `moc` block:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Meetings
element: Blockquote
filter: has_tag("#decision")
recursive: true
template: bullet-link
```
````

### Find & Replace rules and spacing customisation
Extract paragraphs containing the word "meeting", applying a chain of two cleanup rules, with empty lines between paragraphs from the same note and divider lines between different note blocks:

````yaml
```moc
folder: Meetings
element: Paragraph
filter: contains("meeting")
applyFnR: ["remove-redundancies", "clean-headers"]
blockSeparator: newline
noteSeparator: divider
```
````

### Dynamic parameters
List all elements from the same folder as the current note that reference its filename:

````yaml
```moc
folder: "{{this.folder}}"
element: List
filter: contains("{{this.filename}}")
recursive: false
```
````
