# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## In-progress

- **Fix: Refresh on rename and move** — `moc` blocks now refresh when a note is renamed or moved into, out of, or within the watched folder. Previously a moved-in note stayed missing, and a moved-out or renamed note lingered with a dead link, until some other edit triggered a refresh. Renaming a folder refreshes every block watching notes inside it.
- **Fix: Renaming the note that holds a block** — The block now follows its note's new path, so `{{this.filename}}`, `{{this.folder}}` and `{{this.path}}` re-resolve against the new name, and **Copy** and **Bake** keep working instead of reporting "Source file not found".
- **Fix: Refresh on template edits** — Editing a template note now refreshes the blocks that use it. Template folders usually sit outside the watched folder, so these edits were previously ignored.
- **Fix: Missing folder error** — A block whose `folder` does not exist, for example after the folder was renamed, now says so instead of reporting that the folder contains no notes.
- **Fix: Excluded notes no longer trigger refreshes** — Edits inside an `excludeFolder` or to an `excludeFile` no longer re-render the block. Scanning and auto-refresh now share one scope check, so they can no longer disagree about which notes a block covers.
- **Showcase: Renames and moves** — **Create showcase** now adds note 15 and a `rename-lab` sandbox folder with step-by-step walkthroughs for each of the fixes above.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-09-26

- **Feature: Interactive tasks** — Task checkboxes in a rendered `moc` block now write back to their source note. Clicking a checkbox toggles the matching `- [ ]` in the original file, and the block's existing auto-refresh reconciles the view. Works for nested subtasks, ordered-list tasks, and tasks inside extracted headings, blockquotes and callouts. Writes are guarded by a source-line match, so a stale block can never overwrite a newer edit. Blocks render their checkboxes disabled when `template` or `applyFnR` actually rewrites the matched text, since rewriting breaks the mapping back to source lines; output that comes back unchanged stays interactive. Can be turned off with the new **Interactive tasks** setting.

- **Feature: Jump to source** — Every matched block now renders with a hover-revealed button that opens its source note scrolled to the exact line the block starts at, with mod-click to open in a new pane. Blocks are rendered into individual containers so each one has its own handle, and `blockSeparator` spacing is preserved. Can be turned off with the new **Jump to source** setting.

- **Feature: Separate file and result limits** — Added `fileLimit`, `fileOffset`, `blockLimit`, `blockOffset` and `blocksPerFile`. `blockLimit` finally expresses "show me 20 results", which the old file-counting `limit` could not; `blocksPerFile` stops one busy note filling the whole result window; `blockOffset` paginates results rather than notes. `limit` and `offset` keep working as aliases for `fileLimit`/`fileOffset`, with the explicit key winning if both are set. `showCount` now reports `20 of 137 results in 8 files` when results were trimmed, and extraction stops reading files once the block window is full.

- **UI: Wizard read-only hint** — The MOC Creation Wizard now warns inline when a `Task` or `List` block is given a template or a find-and-replace rule, since reshaping the output makes its task checkboxes read-only.


## 1.4.0 - 2026-08-16

- **Feature: Copy as Markdown** — Added a Copy button to the MOC block toolbar that copies the rendered Markdown output to the clipboard without modifying the note.
- **Feature: `properties()` comparison operators** — Added `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` operators to `properties()` filters for numeric and date comparisons (e.g. `properties(priority <= 2)`, `properties(date >= "2024-01-01")`).
- **Feature: `template` option** — Custom output formatting for each matched element by referencing a template note (configured via the **Template folder** setting) whose content uses `{{content}}`, `{{file}}`, `{{path}}`, and `{{link}}` handlebars-style placeholders.
- **Feature: `excludeFolder` and `excludeFile` options** — Explicitly exclude specific folders or files from MOC results even when they fall within the configured scan folder. Accepts a single string or JSON array.
- **Feature: `showCount` option** — Appends a result count summary (e.g. "3 results in 2 files") and adds per-group counts when `groupBy` is active.
- **Feature: `offset` parameter** — Skip a number of files at the start of the result set, complementing `limit` for paginated or windowed result sets.
- **Feature: `groupBy: property(key)`** — Group matched results by an arbitrary frontmatter property value.
- **Feature: Live auto-refresh** — MOC blocks automatically re-render (debounced 500 ms) when any Markdown file in the configured folder is created, modified, or deleted.
- **Feature: Create showcase command** — New "Create showcase" command generates a `MOC Showcase` folder at the vault root with sample notes and pre-built `moc` blocks covering every feature, including a dedicated note for `blockSeparator`/`noteSeparator` spacing and dynamic parameters.
- **Feature: Standardized filters & aliases** — Consolidated `has_word`, `contains`, `has_text` into canonical `contains`; `has_word` and `has_text` remain as backward-compatible aliases.
- **Feature: Robust tag-aware matching** — `has_tag()` matches exact tags case-insensitively and nested subtags, preventing false positives.
- **Feature: Enhanced `matches()` with regex flags** — Slash-delimited patterns with flags: `matches("/pattern/i")`.
- **Feature: Context-aware autocomplete** — The MOC Creation Wizard hides task-only filters (`is_completed`, `is_incomplete`) when a non-task element type is selected.
- **UI: Redesigned settings tab** — Icon-driven card layout for Templates and Find & Replace, native Obsidian icon buttons in place of emoji, and a cleaner add/edit rule form.
- **UI: Redesigned MOC Creation Wizard** — Wizard sections (Source, Filters, Shaping, Result manipulations) now use the same icon-driven card layout, with icon buttons replacing text/emoji controls throughout the filter builder and rule chain.
- **Fix: `template` option documentation and showcase example** — The `template` key takes the *name* of a template note (resolved against the Template folder setting), not inline placeholder text. Corrected the showcase's template note (09) and all docs/README references that previously showed inline `template: "..."` strings that would fail to resolve.
- **Docs**: Verified versioned Docusaurus deployment workflow and automated changelog syncing.


## 1.3.3 - 2026-06-30

## 1.3.2 - 2026-06-30

## 1.3.1 - 2026-06-30

## 1.3.0 - 2026-06-30

- **Feature: Reusable Find & Replace Rules** — Added a rules manager to the settings panel allowing users to define reusable find-and-replace literal or regex transformations. These can be selected via a dropdown in the MOC Wizard or referenced in MOC blocks using `applyFnR: <RuleName>` (or sequentially chained using array syntax like `applyFnR: [<rule1>, <rule2>]`).
- **Feature: Decoupled Block & Note Separators** — Added support for configuring separators at two levels: between adjacent matched blocks in the same note (`blockSeparator`) and between different note sections (`noteSeparator`). Users can configure both separators to be `None`, `Divider line` (inserts `---`), or `Empty line` through dropdowns in the MOC Wizard or YAML keys.

## 1.2.7 - 2026-06-29
