# Maps of Content

Dynamically generate **Map of Content (MOC)** indexes by extracting matching elements (lists, tasks, headings, paragraphs, blockquotes) from notes in your vault — powered by a simple code block.

📖 **[Full documentation →](https://mkshp-dev.github.io/obsidian-MOC-plugin/)**

---

## Highlights

**Live, auto-updating indexes** — `moc` blocks re-render automatically when files in the watched folder change. No refreshing needed.

**Interactive tasks** — Tick a task checkbox in a rendered `moc` block and it updates in its source note, guarded against writing over newer edits.

**Jump to source** — Every matched block has a button that opens its source note at the exact line it came from.

**Powerful filter DSL** — Boolean logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), text matching, tag matching, regex, and frontmatter property comparisons with full numeric/date operator support (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`).

**MOC Creation Wizard** — Generate `moc` blocks visually from the Command Palette. No YAML required.

**Flexible output shaping** — Group by folder, tag, date, or any frontmatter property. Sort, and limit by notes scanned (`fileLimit`), total results (`blockLimit`) or results per note (`blocksPerFile`), with matching offsets for pagination.

**Templates** — Format each matched element using a reusable template note with `{{content}}`, `{{file}}`, `{{path}}`, `{{link}}` placeholders.

**Exclude options** — Skip specific folders or files even inside a recursive scan.

**Copy & Bake** — Copy rendered Markdown to clipboard, or permanently bake a dynamic block into static Markdown in-place.

**Create showcase** — Run **Maps of Content: Create showcase** from the Command Palette to generate a ready-to-explore demo folder covering every feature.
